## 📌 Problem

Medical reports are often difficult for non-medical users to understand.

Most people receive a PDF containing dozens of laboratory parameters without knowing:

- What each test measures
- Whether the result is concerning
- Which organs are affected
- What lifestyle changes may help
- When to consult a doctor

AI Health Companion transforms complex pathology reports into simple, personalized health insights.

### 🎯 Deterministic Processing Pipeline

Unlike traditional AI prompts that produce inconsistent results, this project separates extraction and explanation into two independent AI workflows.

This significantly improves reliability and consistency.

# 🧠 AI Workflow

## Step 1 — Test Extraction

The first AI call extracts structured laboratory data only.

```json
{
  "name": "Vitamin D",
  "value": "18",
  "unit": "ng/mL",
  "range": "30-100",
  "status": "Low"
}
```

No explanations are generated during this step.

---

## Step 2 — AI Insights

The second AI call receives structured JSON and generates:

- Explanations
- Causes
- Symptoms
- Foods
- Exercise
- Doctor Advice
- Questions to Ask

This separation makes the output significantly more reliable.
